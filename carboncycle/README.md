# carboncycle
This repository contains open data, extracted from ICOS Carbon Portal(https://www.icos-cp.eu/data). The data is intended to be used by the schoolprog-satellite repository.
More in particular, the data is to be used in conjunction with the "kolcykeln" notebook.

# Structure
-  There is one directory for each data file
-  In each directory, there is a README. It should contain info about the source, the license that applies, and a short description of each data file.
