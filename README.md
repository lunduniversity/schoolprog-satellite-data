# schoolprog-satellite-data
This repository contains open data, extracted from various sources, and intended to be used by the schoolprog-satellite repository.

# Structure
-  There is one directory for each data source
-  In each directory, there is a README. It should contain info about the source, the license that applies, and a short description of each data file.

# Instructions for adding data
-  You can add and edit information online (no need to clone the repo)
-  To add a new directory, say `src`, create a new file `src/README.md`. The new dir `src` is added as a side-effect of creating the README.md file.
-  To upload a file, click Upload and drag-and-drop the file. Don't forget to update the README.
